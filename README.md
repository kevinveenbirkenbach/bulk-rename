# Bulk Rename 🚀

Bulk Rename is a Python-based command-line tool that renames files in bulk by replacing specified substrings in their filenames. It supports both recursive and non-recursive renaming, and it’s installable via [Kevin's Package-Manager](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/package-manager) under the alias `bure`.

## Features ✨

- **Bulk File Renaming:** Replace a specified substring in file names with a new string.
- **Recursive Option:** Rename files in subdirectories using the `-r` or `--recursive` flag.
- **Verbose Output:** Displays each renaming action for clear tracking.

## Installation 📦

Install Bulk Rename via [Kevin's Package-Manager](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/package-manager):

```bash
pkgmgr clone bulk-rename
pkgmgr install bulk-rename
```

Once installed, you can call the tool globally with the alias:

```bash
bure search_string replacement_string [options]
```

## Usage 🛠️

The main script is stored in `main.py`. You can run it directly:

```bash
./main.py search_string replacement_string [-r|--recursive]
```

- **search_string:** The substring to search for in file names.
- **replacement_string:** The substring to replace the search string with.
- **-r, --recursive:** (Optional) Recursively rename files in all subdirectories.
